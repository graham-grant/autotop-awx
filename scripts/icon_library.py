"""
Loads a draw.io custom shape library (the .xml file you get from
Extras > Edit Diagram on a library, or File > Open Library From >
Device... format: <mxlibrary>[{xml, w, h, aspect, title}, ...]</mxlibrary>)
and exposes each entry's image style by title, so renderer.py can stamp a
device's preferred icon onto its node cell instead of the plain rectangle.

Each library entry's "xml" field is an HTML-entity-encoded mxGraphModel
fragment. Simple entries are a single mxCell with
style="shape=image;...;image=data:image/svg+xml,<base64>;" - that style
string is exactly what we want to drop onto a node's cell.

Composite entries (e.g. rack-front photos imported from Visio) wrap that
image cell inside extra decorative cells and sometimes drop the
"shape=image" token entirely (a vsdx-import quirk - the style ends up as
bare "image;...;image=data:...;" instead of "shape=image;...;"). We find
the first descendant cell carrying an image=data: payload and normalize
the style so "shape=image" is always present. We do NOT attempt to
reconstruct any sibling decorative cells (outlines, bezels, etc.) - for
multi-cell composites you'll get just the photo, not the full illustration.
